# Country size and HDI correlation
This is a data analysis personal project where I explore the correlation between a country size (land) and its human development index (HDI)

## the hypothesis:
Smaller countries would have an easier time covering their population with access to essential services like hospitals and schools but also commodities, cultural centers, and quality of life related services, and as the HDI is based on the health, education, and economy of a country, smaller countries on average may have higher HDI.
